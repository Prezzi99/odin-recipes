    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Jamaican curry chicken is a popular dish that is enjoyed by many. It is 
        a bold, flavorful dish that's cooked slowly over low heat, allowing time for the spicies to develop
        It contains pieces of juicy chicken, along with carrots and potatoes. The potatoes break down a little and help thicken
        the broth. Its bright yellow color comes from Jamaican curry powder. Scotch bonnet peppers give it a sweet,
        fruity heat. It's believed that the dish came to Jamaica in the 17th 
        century when workers from East India were brought to the British colony
