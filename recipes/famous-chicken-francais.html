    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken Française, also known as "Chicken Francese" or "Chicken Français," is a popular 
        Italian-American dish. It typically consists of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that are 
        dredged in flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and then sautéed in a lemon and butter sauce. The dish 
        is characterized by its tangy and citrusy flavor, thanks to the lemony sauce.
        Chicken Française is often served with steamed vegetables, rice, or pasta. The tangy lemon sauce 
        complements the tender and crispy chicken, making it a delightful and flavorful dish.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them 
            to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip the floured chicken breasts into the beaten eggs, coating them evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 
            3-4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same skillet, add chicken broth, lemon juice, and white wine. 
            Bring to a boil and let it reduce slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the butter until melted and the sauce has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning some sauce over 
            the top, and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
