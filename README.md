# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Recipes Website

This project contains on separate pages, recipes for three meals. The following skills were deployed to 
actualize the project:

1. Use of the h1 and h3 headers.
2. Proper use of the img tag and appropriate attributes (src, width, height)
3. Use of the anchor tag to link to different pages.
4. Use of unordered and ordered lists.
5. Use of nested lists (an unordered list within an ordered list).
